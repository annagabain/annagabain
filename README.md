    -  Mom Network - Communication Tool for Busy Mothers.
    -  A content- sharing web application with React and an API (Django Rest Framework) Back-End.
    -  Users browse and comment/ like, follow each other's content as well as add, edit and delete their own.
- ðŸ”­ and building a small social Advertisement platform with Vue and API.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Django REST Framework.
- ðŸŒ± As well as Vue.js for a Front-end developer starter role at a nice company.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for like-minded people: developers, designers.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a Frontend Developer Traineeship at a larger company.
