### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my fifth and final Portfolio project with Code Institute: 
    -  Project title: Mom Network - Communication Tool for Busy Mothers.
    -  It is a content- sharing web application with React and an API (Django Rest Framework) Back-End.
    -  Users will be able to browse and comment/ like, follow each other's content as well as add, edit and delete their own.
    -  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Django REST Framework.
- ðŸ”­  I have recently tried out Vue.js and built a small social Advertisement platform that talks to an API.
    - ðŸŒ± This project can be useful for a Front-end developer starter role at a nice company.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for like-minded people: developers, designers, recruiters, product/project owners.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a Frontend Developer Traineeship at a larger company.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my other skills.
- âš¡ Fun fact: music theory and programming have some similarities.
