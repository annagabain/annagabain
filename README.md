### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my fifth and final Portfolio project with Code Institute: 
    -  Mom Network - Communication Tool for Busy Mothers.
    -  A content- sharing web application with React and an API (Django Rest Framework) Back-End.
    -  Users browse and comment/ like, follow each other's content as well as add, edit and delete their own.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Essentials and Django REST Framework.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for like-minded people.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a Frontend Developer Traineeship at a larger company.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my other skills.
- âš¡ Fun fact: music theory and programming have some similarities.
