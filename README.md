### Hi there 👋


- 🕵️‍♀️ **I’m looking for a Frontend / Fullstack Developer Job at a larger company in Stockholm or remotely in Sweden.**
- :mortar_board: Currently enhancing my frontend skills with **Lexicon** - the Swedish job market oriented school.

- 🔭 I have recently finished working on my final Portfolio project with **Code Institute**: 
    -  Project title: Mom Network - Communication Tool for Busy Mothers.
    -  It is a content- sharing web application with **React** and an **API** (Django Rest Framework) Back-End.
    -  Users browse each other's content as well as add, edit and delete their own.

- 👯 I’m looking for like-minded people: developers, designers, recruiters, product/project owners.
  
- 💬 Ask me about my other skills.
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: music theory and programming have some similarities.
