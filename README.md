### Hi there 👋


- 🕵️‍♀️ I’m looking for a Frontend / Fullstack Developer  / UX designer Traineeship at a larger company in Stockholm or remotely in Europe.

- 🔭 I have recently finished working on my fifth and final Portfolio project with Code Institute: 
    -  Project title: Mom Network - Communication Tool for Busy Mothers.
    -  It is a content- sharing web application with React and an API (Django Rest Framework) Back-End.
    -  Users browse each other's content as well as add, edit and delete their own.

- 👯 I’m looking for like-minded people: developers, designers, recruiters, product/project owners.
- 
- 💬 Ask me about my other skills.
- 
- ⚡ Fun fact: music theory and programming have some similarities.
