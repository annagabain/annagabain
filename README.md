### Hi there 👋


- 🕵️‍♀️ I’m looking for a Frontend / Fullstack Developer  / UX designer Traineeship at a larger company in Stockholm.


- 🔭 I have just finished working on my fifth and final Portfolio project with Code Institute: 
    -  Project title: Mom Network - Communication Tool for Busy Mothers.
    -  It is a content- sharing web application with React and an API (Django Rest Framework) Back-End.
    -  Users browse each other's content as well as add, edit and delete their own.
    -  🌱 I’m currently excercising my knowledge of React and Django REST Framework.
- 🔭  I have recently tried out Vue.js and built a small social Advertisement platform that talks to an API.
    - 🌱 This project can be useful for a Front-end developer starter role at a nice company.
- 👯 I’m looking for like-minded people: developers, designers, recruiters, product/project owners.
- 💬 Ask me about my other skills.
- ⚡ Fun fact: music theory and programming have some similarities.
